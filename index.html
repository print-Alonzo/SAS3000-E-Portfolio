      <h2>Self-Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Alonzo Andrei G. Rimando, a Computer Science student currently taking a BS/MS track at De La Salle University – Manila. I have a strong passion for building software that solves real-world problems, with experience in areas like artificial intelligence, web development, and logic-based systems. Over the past few years, I’ve developed projects such as a Star Classification AI, a Sokoban puzzle solver, and Tafthanan, a student forum for the Taft community. Beyond academics, I’ve taken on leadership roles in organizations like the Lasallian Scholars Society and Toastmasters, where I learned the importance of teamwork, adaptability, and clear communication. These experiences shaped me into someone who’s not only technically capable but also ready to collaborate and lead. As I prepare for my professional career, I’m eager to apply what I’ve learned in a setting where I can continue growing, contributing, and making an impact.</p>

      <h2>Reflection on PCK Results</h2>
      <p>Taking the PCK assessment was an insightful experience that allowed me to better understand my interests, work values, and abilities in relation to my future career. One of my key takeaways was how well my primary interest in Conventional roles and secondary interest in Enterprising roles align with structured yet dynamic environments, such as those in business, technology, and administration. This made me realize that I naturally thrive in organized systems where I can lead initiatives, follow procedures, and contribute meaningfully to projects with clear expectations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Work Importance Profiler results also revealed a lot about what I truly value in a professional setting. My top work values—Achievement, Recognition, and Relationships—reflect my desire to apply my skills meaningfully, be acknowledged for my contributions, and foster positive connections with others. It helped me see that I’m not only driven by personal success but also by impact and collaboration. This reinforces my goal to pursue a career where I can continuously grow, while being part of a supportive and value-aligned team.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The Career Ability Profiler highlighted my strengths in Verbal Ability, Spatial Ability, and Form Perception, while also pointing out areas like Arithmetic Reasoning and Computation where I can still improve. It affirmed my capabilities in areas like technical writing, problem-solving, and visual design—skills I’ve been developing through my software projects and leadership roles. I realized that while I have natural strengths, I must also be intentional in strengthening my weaker areas through practice and continuous learning.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Overall, this assessment helped me gain clarity on potential career paths that suit not only my skills but also my personality and values. Careers like software development, data analysis, compliance, and tech-driven project management stood out as strong matches. I now feel more confident in narrowing my focus and taking active steps—such as building my portfolio and seeking relevant internships—to align my career choices with who I am and who I aspire to be.</p></p>
